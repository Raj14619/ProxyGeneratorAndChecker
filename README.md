# Proxy Generator And Checker for HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS4/SOCK4A/SOCKS5 Proxies by Brute Force

THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. 

Neither I Say Nor I Promote To Do Anything Illegal. I am in no way responsible if you use this program or code maliciously.

To run the code make sure you have python 3 installed (You can check by opening CMD in windows and typing in python - if you don't get a response or get an error you need to install python)

open up CMD and navigate to the folder where you have the repository and install requirements.txt. 
Then Use the following code in CMD: "pip install -r requirements.txt" Press enter.

Then run the following in CMD. "python main.py" and press enter. You should then have the GUI open. Make adjustments if you are aware of what you are doing and then click Start.

This is a brute force attack and it can take an extremely long time to find an IP:PORT which accepts a request. This is not a Proxy Grabber. This is for finding your own exclusive proxies which low amount of people may have access to.

Note: Depending on the amount of RAM/CPU you have you may need to lower the number of proxies to generate per cycle in the GUI. You can tell if your RAM is completely being used up if the program seems stuck. If the program gets stuck you will need to restart the program and lower the number of proxies to generate per cycle
